# React 3 Mini-Project

## Project Summary

In this project, we'll introduce how to use `Axios` inside a React Project to make HTTP requests. We will cover full `CRUD` with (GET, PATCH/PUT, POST, DELETE) and also cover how to use the `.then()` method. 

Don't worry about any preexisting code in this project, the important part here is to focus only on how we are interacting with the API using `Axios`

# Setup

1) `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
2) `cd` into the project directory.
3) Run `npm install` or `yarn`
4) Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
5) In a seperate terminal, `cd` into the project directory.

# API Documentation

We will be using this [API](https://ancient-gods-api.now.sh/).

During this project, we will use an API created by Phoenix Mentor - Hunter Sexton. Please refer to this API documentation when completing the project steps. 

# Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we are going to install the `axios` npm package and setup our API configuration to include a unique API key. 

### Instructions

- Now open `./src/App.js`.
- On line 4, import the already installed package `axios` from 'axios'.
- Next, locate the pre-made `config` object at the top of the Component.
- Next to where it says `apikey:`, insert your own unique string.
    * Ex: 'DevMtn'

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
// import axios package
import axios from 'axios';

// Create unique api key
let apiConfig = {
  headers: {
    apikey: 'DevMtn'
  }
}
```

</details>

# Step 2

### Summary

With this project, we want the list of Gods to load as soon as the page is loaded. To do this, we will utilize the React `componentDidMount()` lifecycle hook and invoke a method we will complete in Step 3.

### Instructions

- In `src/App.js`, navigate to the `componentDidMount()` method just below the constructor function. 
- Inside, invoke the `this.getGods`.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```jsx
  componentDidMount(){
    this.getGods();
  }
```

</details>

# Step 3

### Summary

In this step, we are going to build out the `getGods` method that the `componentDidMount()` will use. This method will make an axios call to get the full list of Gods from the API.

### Instructions

- In `src/App.js` navigate to the method titled `getGods`.
- Inside the `getGods()` method, initialize an axios `GET` request to be sent to the `baseUrl` variable created above and set it to a variable called `myPromise`. 
- On the next line, we are going to use the `.then()` method and attach it to the previously created `myPromise` variable.
- Inside the `.then()`, we are going to use a callback with `res` as a parameter.
- Next, inside the callback, we will invoke `setState` to set the: 
  - `gods` property in state equal to `res.data`, 
  - `oneGod` property set to an empty array,
  - `create` property set to false 

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```jsx
  getGods(){
    let myPromise = axios.get(baseUrl, apiConfig);
    myPromise.then(res => {
      this.setState({
        gods: res.data,
        oneGod: [],
        create: false,
      })
    })
  }
```

</details>

# Step 4

### Summary

In this step, we will complete the `getOneGod` method that will help us isolate a single god to view their additional information. 

### Instructions

- In `src/App.js`, navigate to the `getOneGod` method below the `getGods` method we completed in the last step. 
- Inside the method, initialize another axios `GET` request except this time, don't set it to a variable.
- Since we didn't set the axios call to a variable, in this step we will chain the `.then()` method directly onto the axios call.
- We will pass the `.then()` a callback, with `res` as a parameter and inside the function, we will need`setState` for the following properties:
    - `oneGod` property equal to `res.data`,
    - `gods` to an empty array

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```jsx
    axios.get(`${baseUrl}/${id}`, apiConfig).then(res => {
      this.setState({
        oneGod: res.data,
        gods: []
      })
    })
```

</details>

# Step 5

### Summary

In this step, we'll complete the `updateGod` method to make an axios `PATCH` request to edit a specific gods name. The important part in this step is understanding that the `PATCH` method only updates what needs to be updated.  

### Instructions

- In `src/App.js`, navigate to the `updateGod` method and once inside - initialize an axios `PATCH` request with the `.then()` method attached at the end.
- This time though, we will need to make use of a template literal to use the `id` from state to indicate which god we are updating.
- Additionally, we will need to include the value that we are updating as the body of our request, in this case it will be the destructered name value from state.
- Next, inside the `.then()` we'll need to use another callback that uses `res` as a parameter and then inside the callback, invoke the `setState` function.
- When setting state in this method, we need to set:
  - `oneGod` to the data returned in our response, 
  - `editName` to false,
  - `name` property to an empty string

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```jsx
  updateGod(){
    const { name } = this.state
    const { id } = this.state.oneGod
    axios.patch(`${baseUrl}/${id}`, {name}, apiConfig).then(res => {
      this.setState({
        oneGod: res.data,
        editName: false,
        name: ''
      })
    })
  }
```

</details>

# Step 6

### Summary

To show the different ways to use the `.then()`, we're going to setup an additional function that we'll use in the method we build in step 8. 

### Instructions

- Below the `updateGod` method, create a method titled `updateState` that takes in `promise` as a parameter. 
- Inside this method, use setState to correctly update our applications state once we receive our response. We'll need to setState on the following properties:
  - `gods` to the data's promise
      - console log the promise parameter if you need help
  - `create` and `demigod` to false,
  - `name`, `origin`, `image` and `power` to empty strings

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
  updateState(res){
    this.setState({
      gods: res.data,
      create: false, 
      demigod: false,
      name: '',
      origin: '',
      image: '',
      power: ''
    })
  }
```

</details>

# Step 7

### Summary

In this step, we'll complete the `createGod` method to make an axios `POST` request to edit a specific gods name. The important part in this step is understanding that the `POST` method is used to create a new value.  

### Instructions

- Locate the `createGod` method below the method we created in the previous step.
- Taking advantage of the `newGod` variable already created as a body for our request, make a request using the API documentation for a `POST` request. 
- Once we receive our response, in the requests' `.then()` method, use `res` as a parameter and create a callback that invokes the `updateState` method created in the previous step.


### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
  createGod(){
    let newGod = {
      name: this.state.name,
      mythology: this.state.origin,
      demigod: this.state.demigod,
      image: this.state.image,
      powers: this.state.power
    }
    axios.post(baseUrl, newGod, apiConfig).then(res => this.updateState(res))
  }
```

</details>

# Step 8

### Summary

For our final step, we'll complete the `deleteGod` method to make an axios `DELETE` request to edit a specific gods name. The important part in this step is understanding that the delete method is only used to delete values.  

### Instructions

- Locate the `deleteGod` method.
- Inside, we will need to use axios to make a `DELETE` request to the API according to it's documentation.
- As part of the request URL, make sure to use the `id` to indicate to the API which God we are deleting.
- Once we receive the response, set state on the following properties:
  - `gods` to the response data,
  - `oneGod` to an empty object. 

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> ./src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
 deleteGod(id){
    axios.delete(baseUrl + `/${id}`, apiConfig).then(res => {
      this.setState({
        gods: res.data,
        oneGod: {}
      })
    })
  }
```

</details>

# Black Diamond

If you are looking for extra practice with React on your own time, try spreading this functionality into separate components. The `Update` functionality can be passed as props to an Update Component, or the `Delete` functionality can be used in a Delete Component. You can even create separate components for each button in the Application.
